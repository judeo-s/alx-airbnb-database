# database-script-0x02/seed.sql

This is the database seed script for an Airbnb-like application. It is written in SQL and uses the InnoDB storage engine.

The script inserts sample data into the following tables:

* `User`: 5 users with sample data
* `Property`: 4 properties with sample data
* `Booking`: 5 bookings with sample data
* `Payment`: 5 payments with sample data
* `Review`: 5 reviews with sample data
* `Message`: 5 messages with sample data

The data is designed to be realistic and provide a good starting point for testing and development. You can modify the data to fit your specific needs.

To use this script, simply run it against your database after creating the schema with the `schema.sql` script.
