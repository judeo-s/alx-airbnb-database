# 🏠 ALX Airbnb Database Project

This project is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, designed to teach real-world database design and implementation skills using an Airbnb-like system. It walks through modeling, normalizing, and building a robust relational database with SQL, ensuring performance, scalability, and clean data structure.

---

## 📘 Project Description

Build a production-level database for an Airbnb-like platform, focusing on:

- 📐 Database modeling (ERD)
- 🧹 Normalization (up to 3NF)
- 🏗️ Schema creation with SQL (DDL)
- 🌱 Realistic data seeding (DML)
- 💾 Handling users, properties, bookings, and payments

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Design normalized relational databases for complex systems
- Implement SQL DDL & DML scripts professionally
- Use indexing and constraints for performance
- Collaborate via GitHub and document database workflows

---

## 🔑 Key Tasks

1. **ERD Design** – Visualize entities & relationships
2. **Normalization** – Apply 1NF to 3NF to optimize schema
3. **Schema Creation** – Write SQL scripts with PKs, FKs, constraints, and indexes
4. **Data Seeding** – Populate database with realistic Airbnb-style data

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Proficient in SQL & relational DB principles
- Familiar with Draw.io or similar tools
- Comfortable with Git & GitHub workflows
